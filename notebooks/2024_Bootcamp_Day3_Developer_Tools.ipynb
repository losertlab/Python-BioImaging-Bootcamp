    "5. [Testing](#testing)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we will explore essential developer tools that enhance productivity and collaboration in Python programming, particularly in the context of image analysis. Leveraging these tools will help you manage your code more efficiently, collaborate with peers, and ensure the reliability of your software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals:\n",
    "By the end of this session, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Familiarize yourself with Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).\n",
    "* Understand the importance of developer tools in scientific programming.\n",
    "* Gain hands-on experience with package management using pip, virtualenv, and conda.\n",

    "* Productivity: Task runners, integrated terminals, and support for extensions automate tasks and customize the development environment, saving time and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual Studio Code or VS Code is one of the most popular IDEs available due to it's support for any programming language and open extensions ecosystem.\n",

    "* **Commit**: A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique ID and contains a message describing the changes made.\n",
    "* **Branch**: Branches allow you to develop features, fix bugs, or experiment in isolation from the main codebase. The default branch in a repository is usually called main or master.\n",
    "* **Merge**: Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another. This is often done when a feature is complete and ready to be incorporated into the main branch.\n",
    "* **Conflict:** A conflict occurs when changes in different branches interfere with each other. Resolving conflicts involves manually editing the conflicting files to ensure all desired changes are included.\n",
